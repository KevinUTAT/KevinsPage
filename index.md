## Projects
### [Surviver](https://github.com/KevinUTAT/surviver_dot_IO)
![](res/Sur.png)\
A “Cheat” for the popular web game Surviv.io. \
The program uses YOLO and SORT to recognize and track element on screen (players, trees, etc.) \
and autofiring based on player locations, speed, and obstacles in between.

### [Open Cycle](https://github.com/KevinUTAT/OpenCycle)
![](res/OCadr.png) ![](res/OCmpy.png)\
Microcontroller based open-source cycling computer. Support ESP32 systems,
BLE speedometer and GPS. \
In microPython and C++ (for TWatch platform)

### [Active Dataset](https://github.com/KevinUTAT/active_data_set)
![](res/ADS.png)\
Computer vision data labelling program with a focus on active learning. \
It provide basic class labeling also allows quickly screening and modifying existing labels (That might be auto generated) with some automatic label quality checkers.\
With a “Task” system to streamline workflow of labelling so that a large labelling task can be broken down to sessions and clients to distribute the workload.

### [Geographic Information System](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L7z_F1HgqtQ&ab_channel=KevinXu)
![](res/297.png)
Geographic Information System based on OSM database in C++. \
With graphical user interface and capability of solving pathfinding and travelling currier problem. \
ECE297 project.
